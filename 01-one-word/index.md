## First Draft

You might think that a word SURE is a way of saying "yes" or "absolutely," but guess what? It can be ironic or sarcastic.

I've got inspired by a TV show named Gillmore girls, where one of the main characters, Lorelai – the mother of Rory, is well known for being sarcastic. While watching this show I realized, that it’s a perfect word for this essay. 

Well, let’s get straight to it. At first sight, when someone says, "Sure," it usually means they're agreeing with you. It can have a totally different meaning. Sometimes, they might say it in a way that doesn't sound very friendly, almost like they're not really catching up with the idea. That's irony right there because the word "sure" is pretending to be positive when it's not.

Let's say a friend wants to borrow your super expensive camera, and you're not too happy about it. If you say, "Sure," in a hesitant way, you're not actually excited to lend it, but you're not saying "no" either. It's like a polite way of refusing without actually refusing. I did it a month ago and I felt exactly this way. My Canon camera is in Viena with my best friend right now.

It can also be a doubt. Imagine you're cooking, and someone asks, "Are you sure about this ingredience?" If you say, "Sure," you might be not sure. It's like a secret code for "I'm not really sure, but I don't want to make a big deal about it."

Sometimes, when you get a simple "Sure" as a reply, it might mean the person isn't all that excited and convinced.

In the end, the word "sure" is way more interesting than you'd think. It can be used in all sorts of sneaky ways to show the opposite of what it seems. "Sure" might look friendly on the outside, but it's got a whole world of hidden meanings. So, next time you hear or see "sure," pay close attention.

But maybe I am an overthinker and we can tell the same about other words like „of course“. Is there a posibility of irony and sarcasm in this word? I think yes, but in my opinion it´s still a little bit more positive, haha. I would rather say absolutely, if I mean something. What do you think?

Absolutely sounds that you are pretty convinced about your statement or choice!
