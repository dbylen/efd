Hi!

My name is Diana and my communication skills depend on my mood. Sometimes it's like rollercoaster, every day is different. I can feel confident and friendly one day, but tired and anti social the other. I have always tried to be nice to other people, even when I have a bad day. I just hate those employees that are unpleasant to you. Since then I try not to be :D. I feel like everybody can have a bad day, but not everybody knows how to hide it. So don't take it personally, it's not your fault that somebody is grumpy. And just remember to try your best.

## VOICE
As I said. My voice changes also. There are days when I'm full of energy and there are days when I'm not. 

## TONE

## STYLE
When I text to my friends it's full of emojis, but I can write a pretty good formal mails also. I was a texter in the past. Now I'm not one. I feel like texting takes a lot. Why would you text your friend all day, if you can tell them in real life. At least you'll have non ending conversations. My texts are short and sweet & I keep it for the real time.
