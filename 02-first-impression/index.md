## Introduction

Hi,

my name’s Diana, I’m a graphic designer based in Prague & Rome. My whole family is from Ukraine. So I’m kind of an international girl. I can speak Czech, English, Russian, Ukrainian & I study Italian, I can communicate the basics already.

I currently work for two advertising companies named Saatchi & Saatchi and Prinity, I love teamwork and I’m a big fan of deadlines. I mean, I can make it till deadline if it’s neccessary. I also freelance occasionally, working only with myself is a pleasure too. I studied bussiness academy before an art university, so starting my journey was quite random. I have always had that feeling that I have to create. I can play the guitar, draw, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

I’d say that I’m openminded, friendly, empathic and easy to talk to. In my free time I enjoy spending my time and going for a walks with my puppy, friends & just being in nature. I’m interested in psychology, mindfulness and wellness.  It will not be surprise if I say that I like art, currently I’m working on my Bachelor thesis about Art brut, that’s my most favorite type of art at the moment. I also make art and I have one art brut fun piece of mine. I’m also falling for architecture and photography, mainly analogue.

I enjoy my work mostly when I can be creative in some experimental ways. I love dynamic designs and pieces that just make you feel like something is happening.

I love to design typography that is curvy, dynamic and organic.
I enjoy to work with mixed media ways of designing.
I also do brand & visual identities that have a concept and a strategy behind their logo. When I work with client I see it as a teamwork and collaboration. I really love to search for our solutions and understand their point of views.

I see myself mostly in fashion or some other cultural  industry such as music and production, because I can express myself and clients self the most while designing for them. But thanks to my corporate work I learned to design stuff that I don’t enjoy that much either, sooo It depends.

So that was a bit of me, I’ll get to the visual part next time!:)
