# Year in review

Since I'm a sensitive person and I can really stress a lot about things, this year was really though for me. Projecting the past and remembering everything is a hard part also. I'm the person that more likely remembers the feelings than concrete memories, but let's get right to it.

## Work
Since I got a job, that I've dreamed of after getting out of school, I can't be more grateful. Going on the interview one year ago teached me that I should always give it a shot and stay confident. Now it's been a year? It's crazy, because I have changed a lot. I've improved my InDesign & Photoshop skills, I've got to know a lot of cool people & I learned about how many working positions an advertising company has and believe me that's a lot.
