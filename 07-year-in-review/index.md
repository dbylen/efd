# Year in review

Since I'm a sensitive person and I can really stress a lot about things, this year was really though for me. Projecting the past and remembering everything is a hard part also. I'm the person that more likely remembers the feelings than concrete memories, but let's get right to it.

## Work
Since I got a job, that I've dreamed of after getting out of school, I can't be more grateful. Going on the interview one year ago teached me that I should always give it a shot and stay confident. Now it's been a year? It's crazy, because I have changed a lot. I've improved my InDesign & Photoshop skills, I've got to know a lot of cool people & I learned about how many job positions an advertising company has and believe me that's a lot.

## Bachelor thesis
My Bachelor thesis also showed me that the time flows like water. We had to choose the topic when we were ending the second year. And now? If I could take back the time I would probably pick something different. I just realize how much I've changed and how much I think differently. Main thing that it teached me is not to stress about every little thing tho.

## I became a peace seeker
In my personal life a lot of things changed also. I'm constantly looking for peace and trying to be calm. I'm starting to feel how everyone around me has changed also. We are not those rebelious kids anymore, we are starting to act like adults.

## Conclusion
- I've learned how to find the inner peace.
- I've learned that I should always give it a shot when it comes to "dream job" interviews.
- I've learned to be more confident and to have my own tone of voine in the society and at work.

- I've learned about important life values that are meaningful to me.
