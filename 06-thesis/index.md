## Abstract
The bachelor thesis deals with creating a visual identity for a fictional festival focused on Art brut. The aim of the work was to create a unified visual style that effectively communicates the unique style and character of this specific art form.

The theoretical part focuses on basic information about Art brut, its history, including the contribution of Jean Dubuffet, and Art brut in the Czech Republic. It also explores marketing strategies, brand personality, social networks and festivals.

The practical part focuses on the concrete steps of creating a visual identity for a festival. It starts with identifying the target group and creating a moodboard for inspiration. It then focuses on the actual design of the visual identity, including the logo, colour scheme, fonts and other graphic elements. It also includes an application of this visual identity to the communication mediums such as posters, billboards, social media, websites and other promotional materials.

Key words: Art brut, visual identity, festival, outsider art, primitive art, visual communication, graphic design

## Introduction
Hi guys,

my name is Diana Bylen & I'm a graphic design student.

I've always been interested in psychology and arts. I've learned about Art brut thanks to our Arts history subject. I found it very interesting and I've decided to get to know it more.

After I've done some research and after I've created one "art" piece of mine, I've decided to choose it as my Bachelor thesis topic.
