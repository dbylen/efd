# CREATIVITY

Hi guys,

I'm Diana & I study graphic design.

Sometimes when I' get a new project I struggle a lot. That's why I wanted to share my journey & what I've learned while struggling.

## What is creativity?
„Creativity is the process of using imagination and original thinking to produce something new or innovative.“ source: Chat GPT

Okay, but it's only according to Chat GPT. Let's have a humans POV.

I think it all started when we were children and we wanted to express ourselves. People are creative beings since they're born.
It is not genetic. You can learn to be creative. You are creative. You just have obstacles.
