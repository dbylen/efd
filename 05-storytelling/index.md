## HOW TO BE MORE CREATIVE

First of all. Don't be afraid. Comparism is your worst enemy. If you want to be creative, how can you be, if you don't let those ideas out to the world? I have learned something in an advertising company where I work nowadays. When we have brainstormings, we just scream and shout and let it all out, like will.i.am and Britney Spears. There's nothing wrong with your answer. That's how I think creativity works. Even more - if you share it with someone, he can lift it up!
