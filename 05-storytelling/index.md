## HOW TO BE MORE CREATIVE

First things first, why should we care about creativity? Well, let me tell you, it's what separates us from robots! Creativity is the secret sauce behind all the cool stuff humans have done throughout history.

Now, let's talk about what creativity actually is. Spoiler alert: it's not just for artsy people. It's a skill that anyone can develop, like learning to ride a bike or cooking. Creativity is all about thinking outside the box and coming up with fresh ideas.

First off, you gotta dive deep into whatever you're working on. Research and soak up all the info. Then, take a step back and let your brain do its thing. Sometimes, the best ideas come when you least expect them, like in the shower or while you're zoning out in and English class.

Next, it's time to start playing around with ideas. Write stuff down, doodle, brainstorm with your friends. Don't be afraid. Comparism is your worst enemy. If you want to be creative, how can you be, if you don't let those ideas out to the world? I have learned something in an advertising company where I work nowadays. When we have brainstormings, we just scream and shout and let it all out. Like will.i.am and Britney Spears. There's nothing wrong with your answer. That's how I think creativity works. Even more - if you share it with someone, he can lift it up! Some of the coolest ideas come from taking risks and thinking outside the box.
