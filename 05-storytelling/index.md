# CREATIVITY

Hi guys,

I'm Diana & I study graphic design.

Sometimes when I get a new project I struggle a lot. That's why I wanted to share my journey & what I've learned while struggling.

## What is creativity?
„Creativity is the process of using imagination and original thinking to produce something new or innovative.“ source: Chat GPT

Okay, but it's only according to Chat GPT. Let's have a humans POV.

I think it all started when we were children and we wanted to express ourselves. People are creative beings since they're born.
It is not genetic. You can learn to be creative. You are creative. You just have obstacles.

Since we are adults we have some experience that changed us. We don't have the childish directness anymore. We control ourselves, we control our schedules and we listen to other peoples opinion. Those experience change our personality. PAST CAN'T DEFINE US ANYMORE.

## Little prince
One day I was just laying in my bed and overthinking, cause that's what I usually do when I go to sleep. I had a vision. I remembered about the book that I've read when I was on a primary school. More precisely I've remembered a drawing of the Little prince.

It is so iconic.
