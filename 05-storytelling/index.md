# CREATIVITY

Hi guys,

I'm Diana & I study graphic design.

Sometimes when I get a new project I struggle a lot. That's why I wanted to share my journey & what I've learned while struggling.

## What is creativity?
„Creativity is the process of using imagination and original thinking to produce something new or innovative.“

Okay, but it's only according to Chat GPT. Let's have a humans POV.

I think it has all started when we were children and we wanted to express ourselves. People are creative beings since they're born, in my opinion.
It is not genetic. You can learn to be creative. You are creative. You just have obstacles.

Since we are adults we have life experience that changed us. We don't have the childish directness anymore. We more likely control ourselves and we listen to other peoples opinion.

But guess what? PAST CAN'T DEFINE US ANYMORE.

## Little prince
One day I was just laying in my bed and overthinking, cause that's what I usually do when I go to sleep. I had a vision. I remembered about the book that I've read when I was on a primary school. More precisely I've remembered a drawing of the Little prince.

It is so iconic. When you think of it like... Nothing has stopped him from sticking to his own idea. Despite the fact that the pilot told him that it's a hat, he was claiming that it is a snake that ate an elephant.

We were like this when we were kids also. We've drawn something and we were so happy about it. It was pure happiness that came out of us. Because we didn't have those strict parameters that we have now as adults.
